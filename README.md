## NASA Image Of The Day Scrapper

This is a simple Python Program which scrapes 20 images from Nasa ( https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/iotd.html )
By default, it saves the images in a folder "nas_scr" in your Documents naming each image from 0 to 20.

You can set up windows task scheduler to run the script as per your need and then set your wallpaper as a slideshow of pictures or even a single one if you want. :)
